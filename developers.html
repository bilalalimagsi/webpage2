    He was honored, along with Shinya Yamanaka, with the 2012 Millennium  Technology 
     Prize by the Technology Academy Finland "in recognition of his creation of a new 
      open source operating system for computers leading to <br> the widely used Linux

              the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
              [3][4] Berners-Lee proposed an information management 
               system on 12 March 1989,[5][6] then implemented the first successful
                communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol
                 (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November.[7][8][9][10][11]
           Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortiu
           m (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the 
           Web. He co-founded <br> (with his then-wife-to-be Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. He is a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder's chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).[12] He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI)[13] and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.[14][15] In 2011, he was named as a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation.[16] He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute and is currently an advisor at social network MeWe.[17]
           
           He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server, and helped foster the Web's subsequent explosive development. He currently directs the W3 Consortium, developing tools and standards to further the Web's potential. In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.[18][19]
           
           In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.[20][21] He was named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and has received a number of other accolades for his invention.[22] He was honoured as the "Inventor of the World Wide Web" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in which he appeared working with a vintage NeXT Computer.[23] He tweeted "This is for everyone"[24] which appeared in LED lights attached to the chairs of the audience.[23] He received the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale".[25]</a>

                through co-authorship of the first book on the C programming language (The C Pro

                [8] He authored many Unix programs, including ditroff. Kernighan is coauthor o
